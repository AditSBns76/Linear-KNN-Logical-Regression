# Linear-KNN-Logical-Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric classification and regression algorithm. It operates on the principle that similar data points exist in close proximity to each other in the feature space. When predicting the output for a new instance, KNN identifies the 'k' nearest neighbors (based on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance) and makes predictions based on the majority class (in classification) or the average value (in regression) of these neighbors. KNN is easy to implement and understand but can be computationally expensive for large datasets, as it requires calculating distances for every instance in the dataset.

Key Features:

Non-parametric and instance-based learning.
Sensitive to the choice of 'k' and the distance metric.
Effective for small to medium-sized datasets.
Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. The model assumes a linear relationship between the inputs and the output, represented by the equation (y = mx + b), where (y) is the predicted value, (m) is the slope (coefficient), (x) is the input feature, and (b) is the y-intercept. Linear regression can be applied in simple (one predictor) or multiple (multiple predictors) contexts. It is efficient and interpretable, making it widely used for forecasting and trend analysis.

Key Features:

Assumes a linear relationship between variables.
Can be extended to multiple linear regression for multiple predictors.
Requires assumptions about the distribution of errors (normally distributed).
Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems. Despite its name, it is used to predict the probability that a given instance belongs to a particular class (e.g., 0 or 1). The model uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to map predicted values to probabilities, allowing it to output values between 0 and 1. Logistic regression can also be extended to multiclass classification problems using techniques like One-vs-Rest (OvR). It is a widely used algorithm due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency.

Key Features:

Suitable for binary and multiclass classification.
Outputs probabilities, making it interpretable.
Assumes a linear relationship between the log-odds of the dependent variable and the independent variables.
